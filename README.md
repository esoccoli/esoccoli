# My name is Ella

## Education
I am a first year Game Design and Development student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I play the viola and am a member of the Game Symphony Orchestra. I also want to minor in music.

## Skills
Currently, I am familiar with C#, Java, and Python. I am most comfortable writing C#, but I am able to use any of them. I would also like to learn Javascript soon.
I have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, and have seen some LaTeX. I would like to learn them all eventually.

## Activities
I am a member of @ComputerScienceHouse and am involved with the devcade project. Devcade is a CSH project with the goal of making a custom arcade machine from scratch. All of the games will be made by members of CSH. I recently completed Brick Breaker, which is a recreation of Atari Breakout written in C#, specifically the MonoGame framework.
